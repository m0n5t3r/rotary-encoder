Rotary encoder
==============

This will be a DIY optical rotary encoder

Why?
====

For fun, and because optical encoders cost an arm and a leg. Initial BOM for 10 pieces places this thing around the price of a mechanical encoder.

None of this is tested yet.

How?
====

You'll need:

* electronics stuff (PCB making, soldering, etc.)
* lathe, probably mill too (haven't gotten to the mechanical part yet)
* printer, transparency film (for encoder discs)
